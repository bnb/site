    <P>We’re living in a global world. Everybody is
    connected to everyone through the internet and its broad
    variety of products which want you to spend even more time with it.</P>

    <P>Sure, something like the internet needs standards. There are
    many many people out there contributing to it every day, from thousands
    of countries all over the earth. There is definitely
    a need for a global language which can be understood
    by everyone. And this is English.</P>

    <P>It’s an easy language — compared to other ones. It’s the
    language on which most programming languages are based on. It’s also outside
    the internet, nearly everybody knows it.</P>

    <P>While developing products, setting up wikis and GitHub
    repositories, I often came across that one question: Every “creator” on the web
    knows English, so why don’t I just write everything in
    this language? It would be easy for me and well understandable
    by developers and designers.</P>

    <P>But in my opinion, that’s not how we should deal with this topic. Language
    isn’t just another way how we communicate with other
    individuals around us. It’s also a part of our culture. Century over
    century, human beings formed their speech to easily communicate
    information to other humans. Even if they didn’t do it
    intentionally, they put a huge amount of their livetime into shaping
    each language until it became as easy as it’s today to transmit
    thoughts into other people’s minds using written words or speech.</P>

    <P>And of course that’s not the end. We’re constantly
    changing the way how we speak and write to fit the
    strain and speed of our everyday life.</P>

    <P>Every language is beautiful. Currently, there
    are over <b>3.500</b> languages spoken across the world. And in my view, we should
    keep <b>all of them</b>. As humans — especially designers and
    developers, we often tend to make everything as perfect and easy as possible.</P>

    <P>But in this case, that’s not helpful at all.</P>

    <P>Of course, it’s easier to just write everything in one
    language: Everyone could then understand it. But with
    this method, we’ll loose a huge part of our culture. And culture
    is what defines us. It’s what we can use to find
    out what we are. Without it, we would all be the same.</P>

    <P>So don’t support this thinking. You don’t need to translate
    everything into your mother tongue now, but if you have
    enough time, contribute something to human existence and also
    provide another translation in your native language.</P>

    <P>Thank you for giving a fuck! 😘</P>
