    <P>Finally! It{`'`}s been a while since I{`'`}ve blogged properly
    the last time, probably a few years. Why? Well, during this
    time many things changed for me: After I
    left <Link href="http://cuttingegg.de">Cutting Egg</Link> a
    year ago, I started working in a  advertising
    agency called <Link href="https://www.medienreaktor.de">medienreaktor</Link> in addition to
    school (where I{`'`}ll also graduate in a few months). I{`'`}m glad to
    finally get a solid reward for making great websites
    and -apps. Of course, the local cooperation with other people
    interested in my field also helps me to expand my knowledge.</P>

    <P>Meanwhile, about 5-6 years have passed since I started
    disassembling random websites to get to know how they work
    on the dark side of the web (<i>hihi</i>, {`'dark side'`} - sounds
    scary 👻). I{`'`}m happy that I{`'`}m now able to make websites for
    people who like my work and want to support me and I really like
    doing it - of course, it{`'`}s sometimes at bit exhausting, but
    I think for the long haul, it{`'`}s perfect for me.</P>

    <P>But that{`'`}s just the beginning. After school, I{`'`}ll probably
    do an apprenticeship for a couple of years to get to
    know more people in this scene. I also might build some of the
    ideas that I{`'`}ve sketched in my notebook as I{`'`}ll hopefully
    have more time for things like that. This is where my
    blog comes in: I{`'`}d like to build some <b>more connections</b> over
    the web and I{`'`}ll of course also write some more posts
    about handling things the right way & my maybe also about
    my second love: HipHop.</P>
