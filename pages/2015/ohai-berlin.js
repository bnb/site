    <P>When I heard of that whole conference movement a while
    ago, I was firstly a bit confused about why some people
    are spending their time organizing events on which all
    kinds of folks from the internet meet together and talk
    with each other. Every time someone from those big players
    in our industry decided to post a picture of himself
    sitting within the crowd of such a conference, I
    simply couldn{`'`}t understand it. We{`'`}re the internet. If
    we want to talk with people, it doesn{`'`}t
    matter if they{`'`}re on the back side of the world,
    we just need to hit a button and we{`'`}re immediately
    able to both hear and see each other and discuss
    whatever the fuck we would like to discuss.</P>

    <P>But when I got older, I realized that this way
    of communicating can{`'`}t be compared to the
    way how people deal with each other on those events. It
    also feels much less forced and freer. There are
    no connection losses or bad interfaces in
    between, just a nice bunch of people talking
    about their favorite topic.</P>

    <P>Since I{`'`}m just a human and therefore much
    more of a fan of this than chatting with someone over
    the internet, I decided that I have to check out one
    of those conferences at least once. So I tried to find
    one which is interesting but sadly soon forgot about
    it, because I couldn{`'`}t find a suitable one. But then, after
    a long time had passed, I noticed on Twitter that there
    was one about JavaScript starting in Berlin. And since
    I already really liked JS, I brought myself to do it.</P>

    <P>Now there was only one problem which was standing
    between me and the conference: Money. I don{`'`}t know
    exactly why, but I thought a ticket for it would cost
    around 100 euros and then turned out to be over
    700 (or something like that). And then there was
    also the cost for the train ticket and my accommodation
    for three nights. All in all, it was a bit over a
    thousand euros for just two days of talks and All
    You Can Eat Food. It was just too much. But as soon
    as I got sad about that I probably wouldn{`'`}t be
    able to attend the event, their Twitter account
    tweeted about how easy it is to get a scholarship
    if you{`'`}re part of a small, ethnic group. I
    wasn{`'`}t, so I got sad again.</P>

    <P>Thankfully, they told me that they could even
    sponsor {`"`}regular{`"`} people like me if I
    couldn{`'`}t afford it. So on the same
    day, I sent out an application through their web
    form and hoped that I would be selected as one
    of the small group of people which will receive a sponsorship.</P>

    <P>Then one day, I got an email with {`"`}Congrats,
    you{`'`}re going to Berlin!{`"`} in the subject
    line. It was from Simone, one of the great people
    who spent their time organizing those huge
    meetups. And then it started, I got really nervous
    immediately. I knew I will meet new people
    who{`'`}re indeed on the same topic as I, but
    definitely on a different level. But I tried to
    tell myself to stay calm and booked a nice little
    room on Airbnb and packed by stuff for
    the 4-hour trip to Berlin.</P>

    <P>It was a long, exhausting ride on a train with
    really bad WiFi and omnipresent nausea. But
    I{`'`}ve managed to distract myself with music and
    the development of a website which will
    launch soon<Ref id="1"/>.</P>

    <P>As I finally arrived there, I was immediately
    blown away by all those huge buildings, huge crowds
    of business people in grey suits rushing to work
    and students sitting on benches while looking
    strained into books, drinking Starbucks coffee
    and gulping down all kinds of fast food. All in
    all it didn{`'`}t felt like a cozy town to me. But
    much more like a instrument of power which was
    purely created to fit a huge amount of people
    in one place and impress other countries.</P>

    <P>It was definitely the result of the megalomania
    of Germany{`'`}s past politician that I felt like
    I was being crushed by endlessly high castles and
    blocks made of pure concrete and glass.</P>

    <P>Maybe the bombing in the second world war
    and the thereupon as-fast-as-possible created
    buildings played a part in this.</P>

    <P>After walking a bit, a huge quadrangular
    block made of pure concrete and glass showed
    up in front of me. I looked on the sign that
    tells the walkers what is being build here
    and it said something like {`"`}The new Berlin castle{`"`}.</P>

    <P>I took a big step away from the fence, stared at
    the lifeless built and thought {`"`}That{`'`}s not
    a castle, you must be kidding me{`"`}. Then I walked a
    little further and found another sign (more like a
    plastic poster) which showed the number 60
    written in red letters. Under it, there was a text
    in a different font which said {`"`}Current
    liabilities of the city in billions{`"`}.</P>

    <P>Yeah, sure. {`"`}Guys, we haven{`'`}t spend enough
    of our country{`'`}s money yet. Let{`'`}s build a
    crappy looking concrete block for another few
    millions!{`"`}. I guess that pretty much sums
    up my feelings about Berlin. There are definitely
    some great spots, but most if it is just not my thing.</P>

    <H2>The Conference</H2>

    <P>Now enough with that talking about the city
    itself. While I was there, I didn{`'`}t just sit
    around for 4 days, I actually did something. The
    main reason why I even visited Berlin was because
    of my first web
    conference, the <Link href="http://2015.jsconf.eu/">JSConf EU</Link>. It{`'`}s a
    nice event with great food and friendly
    people who{`'`}re presenting cool things
    that are happing around JavaScript.</P>

    <P>Before the first day of the event, I was very
    nervous and went to bed very late. In the morning, I
    woke up early too, just to notice that
    I haven{`'`}t brought my hairdryer with me. Fuck. Once
    I had figured out how to towel them down, the event
    had already started and I prayed that the breakfast is
    still going. Thankfully, I had a few minutes to
    enjoy my pancakes with jam, before the halls
    got opened for the audience.</P>

    <P>Then, the whole room suddenly got completely
    darkened. The only things that were still visible
    were the bright-shining screens of those people, who
    decided not to close their MacBooks for a fucking
    second. I knew that they would come up with a great
    opening, but I did neither
    expect <Link href="https://vimeo.com/140427080">this</Link>, nor <Link href="http://youtu.be/lJ1kY-CSpBk">that</Link>.</P>

    <P>After the beginning, the crew introduced themselves
    and the talks started. It was a great journey through
    all the areas, in which JavaScript is now being used
    to create great things. I felt like they really took
    the whole {`"`}JavaScript everything{`"`} as an attitude
    for life. I heard of a sewing machine running it and Pawel
    Szymczykowski showed us how to build a balloon carrying a payload of
    sensors and cameras which will by launched into
    the Earth’s atmosphere, all thanks to node.</P>

    <P>I don{`'`}t want to dig too much into all the great stuff
    that was shown to us, because all of them will be released
    in the next days on
    their <Link href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsconfeu/videos">YouTube channel</Link>. I{`'`}m
    sadly now able to tell you my favorite talk, because most
    of them were just above ground. But one of those was
    definitely {`"`}Illusion of Time{`"`} by Denys
    Mishunov (where he explained why people don{`'`}t care
    about waiting if they{`'`}re able to move forward while
    they wait and why they do care if they need to wait
    without doing anything) and {`"`}Disconnected
    Networking{`"`} by Razvan Caliman. In this one, he
    showed us how to use various APIs (like audio or
    ambient light) of the newer browser versions to
    transfer data between devices or simply control a computer with gestures.</P>

    <P>Another thing I was very happy about was, that
    Microsoft finally decided to kill the Internet
    Explorer in favor of their new browser: Edge. They
    dropped a huge amount of old code lines and replaced
    them with all the cool features which browsers like
    Chrome already have since a long time. When I got
    back to my agency, I had the chance to install
    Windows 10 on one of our testing devices and I
    noticed that they haven{`'`}t completely removed
    IE yet. But I{`'`}m sure they will, in the near future.</P>

    <P>I also met David Valdman, the creator of the
    talk {`"`}Functional Layout - Updating the DOM
    at 60FPS{`"`} (which happened in a different hall at
    the same time) and we were chatting a bit
    about how big Berlin is and that it{`'`}s not
    comparable to all the beatiful cities we actually
    have in Germany. Thanks to him, I{`'`}m now also
    aware of how much projects like JSConf do to get
    some decent talks for their audience. No matter
    where you live, they will pay for your flight, your
    accommodation and for all your human needs (food, drinks, et cetera).</P>

    <P>All in all, it was a really great event. Altought
    I didn{`'`}t really know where to go at first, I
    found it out a short while later because everything
    was so perfectly organized and explaned through signs and
    the crew. Someone even built a full
    mobile version of the schedule, so
    it was very easy to switch halls if the
    current talk wasn{`'`}t very interesting.</P>

    <P>Oh, I forgot to mention that: The whole event
    took place in two different rooms: The {`"`}Back
    track{`"`} (where I was most of the time) and
    the {`"`}Side track{`"`}. Everyone was allowed
    to change to the other room if the talk on
    the other side was more appealing to him, or just for fun.</P>

    <P>Sadly, I wasn{`'`}t able to stay until the Closing
    Conference and the Group Foto. Since I didn{`'`}t knew
    the schedule when I booked my tickets, I bought one of
    those for the train which can only be used at a certain
    time. I was so thankful that I{`'`}ve received the
    sponsorship, but I still wanted to find the cheapest
    ticket so that I could spend more money on the Airbnb
    room (which was <Link href="https://www.airbnb.de/rooms/7643348">this one</Link>, by
    the way). I was very late when I{`'`}ve decided to book a
    room on Airbnb instead of one in a hotel, so there
    where only a few ones left.</P>

    <P>But as you can see, I got a great one anyway - it was beatiful!</P>

    <H2>tl;dr</H2>

    <P>If you have the chance to attend one of
    those web conferences, do it! You will meet a lot
    of great people, stay up-to-date with the new stuff
    in our industry and also have a lot of fun!</P>

    <P>On of the biggest problems I personally had
    was simply being too shy to do it. But trust me, those
    people are a lot nicer than the the average
    person you{`'`}ll meet on the street!</P>
