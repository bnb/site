    <P>{`"`}Are you stupid?{`"`} — Well, in some cases, I am. In some
    others, I{`'`}m not. But I definitely know that you
    are. Why? Because you{`'`}re asking me such a dumb question.</P>

    <P>If a person is {`"`}dumb{`"`} or not, depends on the intellect of the
    person who{`'`}s judging. If you ask Elon Musk if Homer Simpson is
    more dumb than him, he will probably answer you with <i>Yes</i>. But if
    you ask a person who{`'`}s more dumb than Homer Simpson (I{`'`}m not
    sure if that{`'`}s even possible), she will definitely answer you
    with <i>No</i> (at least if she{`'`}s being honest). To cut a
    long story short: The state {`"`}dumb{`"`} is relative to the
    judging person{`'`}s intellect. More clearly: If you{`'`}re asking
    a person about being {`"`}dumb{`"`} in a non-rhetorical
    context, you{`'`}re the dumb one.</P>

    <P>So now tell me, how should I know by myself if I{`'`}m dumb or
    not? Right, I can{`'`}t! I would have to compare
    my own state of intellect with itself. And you should know
    that comparing things with themselves is technically
    not possible. But since you{`'`}ve asked me that
    question, you don{`'`}t. Therefore I{`'`}m free to call you dumb.</P>

    <HR/>

    <P>If someone asks you if you{`'`}re dumb, you{`'`}re free to use the first
    paragraph as an answer. But beware: If the person who{`'`}s asking
    you is smart enough, she will answer with {`"`}It{`'`}s a
    rhetorical question, you moron.{`"`}</P>
